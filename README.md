# My .NET Learning Journey 🚀

> "You don't have to be born a programmer – you can become one through discipline and patience."

## About This Repository
This repository documents my transition from a 25-year career in sales to becoming a professional .NET Software Developer. It serves as a living proof of concept for hard work, consistency, and the willingness to start over.

Here you will find my code exercises, labs, and projects as I progress through my education in **.NET System Development**.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized by learning modules and concepts:

* **Module-02-AdvancedOOP**: Deep diving into C# memory management, OOP principles, and type systems.
    * * [Exercise 01: Struct vs Class](.NET%20Framework/Module-02-AdvancedOOP/Exercise_01_StructVsClass/Exercise_01_StructVsClass/Program.cs) - Struct vs Class, Stack vs Heap, and Deep Copy.
      
* *(More modules to be added as I progress)*

## Tech Stack & Tools
* **Language:** C# 12 / .NET 8
* **IDE:** JetBrains Rider
* **Focus:** Backend Development, Clean Code, Object-Oriented Programming

## My Goal
To build a solid foundation in software development, aiming for a role where I can solve real problems using .NET technologies. I treat this repository not just as homework, but as my daily practice ground.
